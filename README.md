# sdltrsXebec

`sdltrsXebec` is a fork of [`sdltrsOMTI`](https://github.com/Egbert-Azure/sdltrsOMTI) (itself a fork of [SDL2TRS](https://gitlab.com/jengun/sdltrs)/xtrs), cloned with full history preserved. `git remote -v` shows `sdltrsomti-upstream`, renamed from `origin` so nothing here can accidentally push back to that project.

The goal is to emulate the **Xebec S1410 SASI hard-disk controller** — the controller GDOS 2.4 and Klaus Kaempf's CP/M port for the TCS Genie IIIs actually use — alongside the OMTI 5527 and WD1000/1010 controllers `sdltrsOMTI` already emulates. The S1410 is closer to the OMTI than to the WD1000, but compatible with neither.

In this fork also the cumbersome and quick and dirty GUI entries in Hardrive menu will be fixed.
OMTI/WD1000 GUI and code architecture — merge, per-slot controller dropdown, or stay separate?

## Status: working, verified end-to-end under real GDOS 2.4

`src/trs_xebec.c` / `.h` implements the S1410 controller core with two host-adapter interfaces onto it:

- **Thomas Holte's CP/M host adapter** at ports `0x40`–`0x42`, the same range the OMTI uses. On real hardware only one controller chip is ever installed, so `src/trs_io.c` routes that range to whichever of the two has an image attached.
- **The TCS Genie IIIs onboard SASI adapter** at ports `0x00`–`0x02`, which is what GDOS 2.4's resident hard-disk driver probes at boot. I found this by live-disassembling the driver in high RAM with scripted `zbx`. This path uses 256-byte sectors where Holte's uses 512, and it was the missing piece behind the long-standing "drives 5/6 never recognized" problem.

Both interfaces share one phase-based SASI state machine (idle → CDB → data in/out → status, with real REQ/BUSY/C-D/I-O status bits and command opcodes verified against `hd2.mac`), and both read and write the same Matthew Reed `.hdv` header format (`src/reed.h`) as the OMTI and WD1000/1010 code.

## Boot ROMs

The original OMTI ports (`0x40`–`0x43`) came from disassembling Arnulf Sopp's 1986 retrofit ROM, which was modified to speak OMTI — not from Xebec-native hardware.

- [`ROM/g3s_8501004_bootrom_2732.bin`](ROM/g3s_8501004_bootrom_2732.bin) — the genuine Xebec-speaking boot ROM.
- [`ROM/g3s_hd-omti_bootrom_2764.bin`](ROM/g3s_hd-omti_bootrom_2764.bin) — the modified EPROM that boots from hard disk regardless of controller.
